TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

17:05 eeeeeeeeeeee first programing

17:45 I had some issues setting everything up, still trying to work everything out. I'm looking forward to when I eventually start to feel comfortable in vcs.

side note why is vcs yelling at me for using the word "eventually"? that seems quite disrespectful. Okay now it's yelling at me for using "quite". Apparently it's a weasel word...

18:12 update - I think I have now finished everything.... it didnt work.

18:24 wow I missed the most obvious thing. Forgot to update my name in the aboutMe. Trying again... failed.

I missed yet another thing. Okay this should be the very last time.
