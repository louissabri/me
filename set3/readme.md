TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

30/06/2022 00:04 working through these exercises one by one has been super cool, I love seeing how the stuff I learned earlier translates. Kudos to you btw Ben, the pacing feels really good I feel like I'm challenged just enough by each new exercise to keep it interesting, without being completely stuck every time I start something new.

30/06/2022 11:25 Getting stuck into this binary search, I want to finish it before I have to leave for campus at 1300.

Right off the bat I see how the guessing game applies to this. It looks like I was applying a binary search by default whenever I played the guessing game of last exercise. Cool.

I'm planning on re using a lot of code from the advanced guessing game. I'm wondering if I should make the lower/upper bounds automatically generated, or let the user input them. Same with the actual number. Could be fun to turn the tables and make the computer guess a number that the user already knows.
