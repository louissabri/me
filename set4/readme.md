TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Current Dataset: https://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php

(eg use all data from major leagues)

https://www.football-data.co.uk/notes

https://openstreetmap.org

Alternate dataset:

https://data.world/barbaramaseda/elon-musk-tweets

https://github.com/twintproject/twint

or use this tool to generate my own dataset of twitter users. Could be interesting to look into.

Edit: ended up going with the 2nd dataset (twitter stuffs).
