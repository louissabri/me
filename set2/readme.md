TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

14:25 We're currently in the lecture, this is very confusing. Ben seems cool tho I am sure it will all make sense eventually.

14:50 update, it's making a bit more sense now. Keen to get into the tut.

15:51 Testing is important, you write tests to check that your code does what you want it to do.
