TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Current Dataset: https://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php

(eg use all data from major leagues)

https://www.football-data.co.uk/notes

https://openstreetmap.org

Alternate dataset:

https://data.world/barbaramaseda/elon-musk-tweets

https://github.com/twintproject/twint

or use this tool to generate my own dataset of twitter users. Could be interesting to look into.

Edit: ended up going with the 2nd dataset (twitter stuffs).

6/7/22 15:07 Starting on set 4, I've finished going through IOexamples.py and am now going to attempt ex 1!

I remember Ben talking about something important to do with IO in the lecture, but that was a few weeks ago and I've forgotten what he said. I guess this is why it's important to do the work on time.
