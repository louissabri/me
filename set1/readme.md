TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

17:05 eeeeeeeeeeee first programing

17:45 I had some issues setting everything up, still trying to work everything out. I'm looking forward to when I eventually start to feel comfortable in vcs.

side note why is vcs yelling at me for using the word "eventually"? that seems quite disrespectful. Okay now it's yelling at me for using "quite". Apparently it's a weasel word...
