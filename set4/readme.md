TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Current Dataset: https://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php

(eg use all data from major leagues)

https://www.football-data.co.uk/notes

https://openstreetmap.org

Alternate dataset:

https://data.world/barbaramaseda/elon-musk-tweets

https://github.com/twintproject/twint

or use this tool to generate my own dataset of twitter users. Could be interesting to look into.

Edit: ended up going with the 2nd dataset (twitter stuffs).

6/7/22 15:07 Starting on set 4, I've finished going through IOexamples.py and am now going to attempt ex 1!

I remember Ben talking about something important to do with IO in the lecture, but that was a few weeks ago and I've forgotten what he said. I guess this is why it's important to do the work on time.

Edit: watching the videos on design-computing.github.io is really helpful.

7/7/22 12:50 it has taken me aaaaaages to understand how to drill into nested collections and pull an element out. I must have missed something fundamental early on, had to go back to the week 2 lecture so I could understand.

Was such a great feeling when I finally figured it out. Both understanding how it works and the correct syntax felt like a nightmare.

13/07/22 17:29 Just cracked the pokedex. I went through the range low - high and appended the height of each pokemon into a list, the plan was then to search that list and pull the index of the highest value (tallest pokemon in the range) and use that to pull the required data for the tallest pokemon. I spent some time trying to write a binary search algo to go through the heightlist and pull out the tallest value lol. Eventually I realised how silly that approach was and decided to google my way out of the problem, discovering python's "max" and "index" functions, ultimatley solving the problem. I was too stubbornly set on finding a solution myself and ended up wasting time on that silly binary search.
