TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

14:25 We're currently in the lecture, this is very confusing. Ben seems cool tho I am sure it will all make sense eventually.

14:50 update, it's making a bit more sense now. Keen to get into the tut.

15:51 Testing is important, you write tests to check that your code does what you want it to do. 

16:20 Not an important note but I felt like it would be good to write down for future me to look back on. I am so confused right now about everything going on, but one day soon I'll be much less confused. Will be interesting to remember how I feel right now in the future when I actually know whats going on.

17:47 I wrote the above comments over like an hour because I kept getting distracted

18:16 now that I am no longer distracted I am getting a lot more done lol. Amber was very helpful.
