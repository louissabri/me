TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

14:25 We're currently in the lecture, this is very confusing. Ben seems cool tho I am sure it will all make sense eventually.

14:50 update, it's making a bit more sense now. Keen to get into the tut.

15:51 Testing is important, you write tests to check that your code does what you want it to do. 

16:20 Not an important note but I felt like it would be good to write down for future me to look back on. I am so confused right now about everything going on, but one day soon I'll be much less confused. Will be interesting to remember how I feel right now in the future when I actually know whats going on.

17:47 I wrote the above comments over like an hour because I kept getting distracted

18:16 now that I am no longer distracted I am getting a lot more done lol. Amber was very helpful.

Note to self: Ask ben about BVN & what to write in these lab books

16:09 (week 3) I did not finish everything that I was meant to last week, I have a lot of work to catch up on now.

17:00 Ok im not as far behind as i thought I was. Currently up to set 2 ex 3. Will finish this asap and move on to set 3 tonight.

17:03 (working on is_odd). the % sign is an operator in python, it returns the remainder of a division. I can use this to work out if a number is odd or even, then return a true value. Main problem is the syntax here, I don't know how to write what my brain has cooked up.

Update: forgot to add the else part of the if loop, but other than that it worked perfectly! Figuring out syntax is kinda tough.

17:58 I've discovered that randomly typing stuff that I think *should* make sense, usually makes sense. Google also helps.

18:43 I've now discovered you need to "close" loops.

18:41 I've got the current exercise (loops_5, coordinates) working conceptually, but need to get the formatting right. At the moment I'm concatenating the strings, but I have realised the limitations of using this method. I am now looking into using format & f strings.

I feel like I am starting to understand programming.

11:10 Question, to "call" something means to run that code/function right? 

(p.s. I havent been working this whole time on one problem dont worry, I went to get snacks then accidentally didnt come back for a while).
