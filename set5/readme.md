TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Working on re factoring, I am passing all but 2 of the tests so need to dive into this and see whats going wrong.

The concept of re factoring makes a fair bit of sense. I imagine that a lot of the time it isn't necessary though. It can make the code harder to read as you need to jump around a lot more. I guess that is because I am new to reading code and haven't seen many big code bases. I do imagine that in huge program it would make things easier to read, but for the stuff I've been doing thus far it seems unnecessary.

These labbooks are basically just big brain dumps for me btw, I am not editing any of my writing if u couldn't already tell. Apologies if you are reading this.
