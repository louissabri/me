TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

29/06/22 12:48 I can't get loop_ranger to work with a while loop & in the interest of time I am going to move on but I would like to come back to this and work it out.

Also I found this dataset that I kinda wanna use:
https://data.world/barbaramaseda/elon-musk-tweets

https://github.com/twintproject/twint

or use this tool to generate my own dataset of twitter users. Could be interesting to look into.

14:11 I'm stuck on stubborn_asker, it seems to me that i've got it working perfectly when I run the program, yet the tests are not happy with me. I'm not sure where I'm getting it wrong.

17:30 I went through the solution posted on the website and managed to get it working (with some tweaking, for some reason it didn't work when I copied the code from the video directly)

I've deleted my old code that wasn't working which as a bit silly because now I don't know what I was doing wrong and can't learn from it. Ah well. I know the right way now.

17:43 I breezed through the final two exercises! Completed them quickly. On to the next!
